                    A book that empowers you to explore your spiritual self and could well change your life. 
                    "More Than a Life" is the extraordinary story of Sadhguru – a young agnostic who turned yogi, 
                    a wild motorcyclist who turned mystic, a skeptic who turned spiritual guide. Pulsating with 
                    his razor-sharp intelligence, bracing wit and modern-day vocabulary, the book empowers you 
                    to explore your spiritual self and could well change your life. In his early years, Jaggi 
                    Vasudev (or Sadhguru as he is now known) was a chronic truant, a boisterous prankster, 
                    and later a lover of motorbikes and fast cars. It is evident that the same urgency, passion
                    and vitality echo in his spiritual pursuits to this day, from his creation of the historic 
                    Dhyanalinga - the mission of three lifetimes - to his approach as a guru <br>

                    In Sadhguru's view, faith and reason, spirituality and science, the sacred and the material, 
                    cannot be divided into easy binaries. He sees people as "spiritual beings dabbling with the material 
                    rather than the reverse", and liberation as the fundamental longing in every form of life. Truth for 
                    him is a living experience instead of a destination, a conclusion, or a matter of metaphysical speculation. 
                    The possibility of self-realization, he strongly believes, is available to all. Drawing upon extended 
                    conversations with Sadhguru, interviews with Isha colleagues and fellow meditators, poet Arundhathi 
                    Subramaniam presents an evocative portrait of a contemporary mystic and guru – a man who seems to pack 
                    the intensity and adventure of several lifetimes into a single one. <br>

                <p class="speaker-profession">Yogic guru</p>
                <p class="speaker-biography">
                    Bikashananda was born in 2nd of Asar, 2018 BS (July 16, 1962 AD) in a Ganesh Temple in Chhetrapati, 
                    Kathmandu. He was adopted by a childless family where he was reared and cared. In his childhood he 
                    was very mischievous and used to fight with others. He was very poor at studies but quite talented at 
                    painting as a result of which he got an opportunity to visit Soviet Union (Russia) to take part in a 
                    painting competition in 1979 AD. <br>

                    However, after returning from Russia his interest was drawn towards literature and writing because of 
                    the easiness in conveying our thoughts to others. For the next three years, he became a teacher, editor 
                    and a writer. In the mean time he had published a tri-monthly magazine and a weekly magazine for three months. 
                    His idea of publishing the magazines was successful which inspired him further to take on more challenging jobs 
                    and work hard on them. <br>
